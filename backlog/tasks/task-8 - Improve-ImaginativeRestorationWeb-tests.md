## Description

Enhance testing for the web interface using either standard Phoenix LiveView testing approaches or the PhoenixTest library

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Tests should be maintainable and follow Phoenix best practices

## Notes

### Completed Work

Created comprehensive test coverage for AppLive module including:

1. **Display Mode Tests**
   - Mounting correctly with background audio
   - Canvas element presence
   - Page title verification

2. **Capture Mode Tests**  
   - Mounting with webcam components
   - No background audio in capture mode
   - Alternative capture_box parameter support

3. **Webcam Frame Handling**
   - Processing frames when no previous images exist
   - Frame difference detection (skipped - requires image library)
   - Processing significantly different frames (skipped - requires image library)

4. **Real-time Updates**
   - Handling sketch:updated broadcasts
   - Maintaining max 5 recent images
   - Updating existing sketches in-place
   - Thumbnail generation

5. **Error Handling** (skipped - LiveView test limitations)
   - Invalid frame data
   - Missing frame parameters

6. **Configuration Tests**
   - Webcam capture interval usage
   - Image difference threshold configuration

7. **Layout Tests**
   - 4:3 aspect ratio maintenance

### Test Results
- 20 tests total
- 14 passing tests
- 6 skipped tests (require database setup or image processing library)
- 0 failures

### Notes
- Some tests were skipped because they require actual database data or image processing capabilities
- LiveView test limitations prevent direct access to assigns, so tests verify behavior through rendered HTML
- Error handling tests are challenging with LiveView testing framework since errors crash the process
