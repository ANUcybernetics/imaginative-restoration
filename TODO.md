## TODO

- finalise launch script

- get usb-C to HDMI adapter for second screen

- confirm that Daniel can get the USB-A extenders (for ease of setup)

- get paper & pens (in progress)

- test with 1080p camera 873mm above desk, A5-sized paper

### Future

- prompt history view
- allow prompt-scheduling
- add nicer feedback for camera not working, or processing pipeline failed (e.g.
  http error), or missing capture box params, or no AUTH_USERNAME...
