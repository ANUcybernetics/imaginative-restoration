## TODO

- sort out auto-updates for macOS (plus VNC)
- check the script re-starts when power is cycled
- be more creative with the prompts (randomize whole thing perhaps... from a few
  select options)... perhaps go back to a "select at random" thing for the
  creature

### Future

- add a widget (to prompts maybe? which shows DB size/rem on disk)
- download DB (for backup)
- prompt history view
- allow prompt-scheduling
- add nicer feedback for camera not working, or processing pipeline failed (e.g.
  http error), or missing capture box params, or no AUTH_USERNAME...
