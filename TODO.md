## TODO

- see why tailscale isn't working, then try VNC
- check the script re-starts when power is cycled

### Future

- (maybe) consolidate `/prompts` and `/config` endpoints into one page (and add
  DB disk space status, perhaps other metrics)
- download DB (for backup)
- add nicer feedback for camera not working, or processing pipeline failed (e.g.
  http error), or missing capture box params, or no AUTH_USERNAME...
