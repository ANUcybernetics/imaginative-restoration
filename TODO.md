## TODO

- update all the deps
- add tidewave/ash_ai
- update to latest
  [canny flux model](https://replicate.com/black-forest-labs/flux-canny-dev),
  and perhaps update BG removal model to
  [this one](https://replicate.com/851-labs/background-remover) as well
- move position (and check sizing) of things in the new install with new screens
- switch back to the macOS launch script (but this rpi one useful for PANIC!)
- sort out auto-updates for macOS (plus VNC)

### Future

- add a widget (to prompts maybe? which shows DB size/rem on disk)
- download DB (for backup)
- prompt history view
- allow prompt-scheduling
- add nicer feedback for camera not working, or processing pipeline failed (e.g.
  http error), or missing capture box params, or no AUTH_USERNAME...
